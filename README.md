# Fight Simulator
This project aims to create a naturalistic looking fight given random values as each fighters parameters.
## Example Goals
Recreate Jin Mori vs Han Daewi fight from God of Highschool. After making the fight simulator, need to make a 'director' for deciding camera placement, special effects and automatic editing to desired fight length, and finally need to make skins to dress the fighters or use ai to cover the animated skeletons with characters ppl are already invested in.

Imagine making luffy vs big mama in the fight sim for example. One piece is a big sub and is perfect for selling the product.

Imagine it coming preloaded with your favorite characters, or a game mode where you spend points to give your characters certain moves or improve their stats every round, or a story mode that allows you to craft your character as you wish and simply provide the site with fanart to see them come to life fighting. Imagine the audience of 'Write with jenna moreci' getting their hands on this
## Customers
Animation subreddits, fanfiction writers, anime sites, AO3, Fanfiction.net. Imagine a youtube channel with ai generated pictures for the story and these animations for the fights.
