# Fight Simulator
This project aims to create a naturalistic looking fight given random values as each fighters parameters.
## Example Goals
Recreate Jin Mori vs Han Daewi fight from God of Highschool. After making the fight simulator, need to make a 'director' for deciding camera placement, special effects and automatic editing to desired fight length, and finally need to make skins to dress the fighters or use ai to cover the animated skeletons with characters ppl are already invested in.

Imagine making luffy vs big mama in the fight sim for example. One piece is a big sub and is perfect for selling the product.
